# UX

## Key project goals

  - The purpose of this project is to create a front-end application for a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Training Center in Dublin, Ireland. This web aplication needs to provide high quality information to their future students and be easy to navigate through the sections.

## Target audience

  - My target audience is those people who are interested in learning more about the Gentle Art - as it is known the practice of Jiu-Jitsu - as well as those people who already practice the modality.

## Strategy

  - My strategy was to create a single page divided into sections where the user could navigate between them, without the need to open new pages. The section start with a very significant image and a text **"Brazilian jiu jitsu is more than just a sport. It’s more than a martial art. It’s a way to change your life."** that draws the user's attention to wanting to find out more about that "change of life" and question themselves "in which way?". And then they scroll the page down and head deep dive into a new life experience.

## User Research

### New user are looking to:
  1. As a new user, I want to see a presentable website, with a colour palette that matches the purpose of the business and accurate information about "What it is", "Where it is", "How to start", "Why I should learn about" and "How much".
  2. As a new user, I want to see an easy navigation bar and that be self-describing and point to the right content. e.g.: About us should point to a content that speaks about the purpose of the business, or the company itself.
  3. As a new user, I want to see the kind of classes they are offering.
  4. As a new user, I want to see some different pictures of the jiu-jitsu classes and practice itself that might be helpful to imagine what it would be like in reality.
  5. As a new user, I want to see the contact information such as the email address and contact number.
  6. As a new user, I want to see the price of classes and if there is more than one package, that its price is self-descriptive, with information about what each package differs from the other, so that I can assess which one best fits on my need.
  7. As a new user, I want to see a consistent layout with high-quality images that are not stretching or losing quality.

### Frequent users are looking to:
  1. As a frequent user, I want to see an up-to-date website with the latest information about the world of jiu-jitsu.
  2. As a frequent user, I want to see a website that is constantly improving such as the layout, new pictures and new content.
  3. As a frequent user, I want to see more promotions such as discounts and loyalty cards.
  4. As a frequent user, I want to engage with new students in more ways.

# Bugs

## Solved Bugs

When I deployed my project to GitHub Pages I discovered that the responsive menu icon was not opening as expected in some devices. Firstly I was using a icon from Font Awesome. The icon was displayed but wasn't clickable on Iphones, for example. After testing some other options, I decided to change the way to place the icon in the layout. 
- Before: 
```
<button id="responsive-menu-btn"><i class="fas fa-bars"></i></button>
```
  - After: 
```
<input id="responsive-menu-btn" class="responsive-menu-btn" type="checkbox" aria-label="Close menu" role="button"> 
<label class="responsive-menu-label" for="responsive-menu-btn" title="close menu"></label>
```
  - In CSS: 
    - I changed the CSS rules to display the responsive menu icon as shown below:
```
.responsive-menu-label::after {
        content: '☰';
        z-index: 2;
        top: 2rem;
        right: 2rem;
        position: absolute;
        font-size: 3rem;
        line-height: 3rem;
        width: 3rem;
        height: 3.5rem;
        text-align: center;
        padding: 0.5rem;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    .responsive-menu-btn:checked~#menu {
        height: 100vh;
        display: block;
        margin-bottom: 1rem;
    }
    .responsive-menu-btn:checked~.responsive-menu-label::after {
        content: '×';
        font-size: 5rem;
    }
```
That way I got to solve the problem.

  - After requesting some peer code review in the Slack community, some of them pointed out problems in the width of the coach's image, on smaller screens, as shown below: 

<img src="./assets/readme-images/bug.png" alt="mobile screenshot" width="250" height="auto">

  - So I modified the CSS rules through the media queries.

```
@media (max-width: 425px) {
    .circle-container {
        width: 260px;
        height: 260px;
    }
```

Fixed the problem.

1. From the project's [repository](https://github.com/emidiovaleretto/bjj-webapp-ms1-project), go to the **Settings** tab.
2. From the left-hand menu, select the **Pages** tab.
3. Under the **Source** section, select the **Main** branch from the drop-down menu and click **Save**.
4. A message will be displayed to indicate a successful deployment to GitHub pages and provide the live link.
5. The live link can be found here - <a href="https://emidiovaleretto.github.io/bjj-webapp-ms1-project/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://emidiovaleretto.github.io/bjj-webapp-ms1-project/</a>.

# Performance and accessibility testing

## What is considered as accessibility?

 - Accessibility is <strong>the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible</strong>.
 - We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites      accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
  
      - <em>Source: </em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility"><b>MDN Web Docs</b></a>
  
- Accessibility and web performance are not features, they are the <strong>baseline</strong>!
