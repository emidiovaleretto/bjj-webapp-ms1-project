# Performance and accessibility testing

## What is considered as accessibility?

 - Accessibility is <strong>the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible</strong>.
 - We traditionally think of this as being about people with disabilities, but the practice of making sites      accessible also benefits other groups such as those using mobile devices, or those with slow network connections.
  
      - <em>Source: </em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility"><b>MDN Web Docs</b></a>
  
- Accessibility and web performance are not features, they are the <strong>baseline</strong>!
